Project selection
We have opted for project 5 from the list. I was a web and mobile based application. 

Setup 
The project is available in a code base of Gitlab. We divided this into 3 parts as was mentioned in the guidelines. Web, Mobile and APIs. I chose to work on a web application. It was a simple and very easy process to set up this. 
1-	I cloned the web repo.
2-	It was ready to run html file-based application.
3-	I simple run html file and it was running in my pc
